This is a collection of several VStudio projects developed in C# and C++ over the years. 
The projects included in this repository are:
1. CalcComplejos: a complex number calculator
2. MatCalc: a 3x3 matrix calculator
3. Sintonizador: a tool to automatically tune a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller based on control and instrumentation theory. This program was also used to control a process with the tuned PID parameters by interfacing the PC and the process with an FPGA logic board.
4. Monitoreo-refri: an UI developed to receive data from temperature sensors connected to an Arduino board and display a dynamic temperature curve.
